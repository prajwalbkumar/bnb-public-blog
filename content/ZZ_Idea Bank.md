## Guide to Developing Ideas

An idea should follow under the given 3 content buckets in [[Content Buckets]]. Anything beyond is a special case and should be developed only if there is already a strong urge in you to develop. 

- **General Audience Topic** - Systems Thinking and Problem Solving
- **Niche Bucket Topic** - Coding in AEC, Computational Design - Thoughts and Ideas
- **Industry Related Topic** - Thought Leadership on AEC Tech

## The *"For Who So That"* Framework

### For Who :
Take an idea and write it for targeted users.. Write the same topic for different ideas

3 different "For Who" audiences you can tailor your content towards

1. People with 0 Knowledge in AEC Tech
2. People who are just starting out
3. People who are seasoned and highly skilled
4. The person I was in the last 2 years

### So that:
It is the benefit. Change the outcome of the essay for any on of the audience

## The Endless Idea Generator

Get super specific
Dial down the generality of the idea and keep getting specific

**Step 1**: The 4A Framework

	- Actionable Ideas - Here's how
		- Tips: X ways to do Y things better
		- Framworks: X of the most useful framworks I've found for doing y
		- Advice: Most people suck at X. Here's how to do it well
		- Tools: X tools to do Y thing more effectively
		- How to: Step-by-step guide for doing X
		- Curataion: The X best books/podcasts/threads/examples for doing Y
	  
	- Analytical Ideas - Here are the numbers
		- Trend: I se the world going X way
		- Numbers: I studied the numbers beinf X Company
		- Reasons: X reasons Y is true
	
	- Aspirational Ideas - Yes, you can
		- Mistakes & Lessons: I've done X - here's what I learned
		- Mentorship: I learned from X person with a ton of credibility - here's what I learned
		- Advice to Past Self: Things I wish I knew when I started X
		- Growth: I did X,Y,Z - here's how I did it
		
	- Anthropological Ideas - Here's why
		- Contrarian: Everyone believes X, but really Y
		- Observation: 1 thing I've noticed is X
		- Razors: A breakdown of a simple decision - making heuristic
		- Paradoxes: Things that seem 1 way but are really the other way
		- Comparison: X vs Y.

Any idea that passes the content bucket check should fall into any of the 4A Frameworks. Pick the direction before writing the first work.

**Step 2**: Testing Different Proven Approaches

	- How to
	- Lessons Learned
	- Mistakes
	- Quotes
	- Ways
	- Tools
	- Trends
	- Stats
	- Reasons
	- Examples
	- Ebarrassing Moments

The final form of the idea should be structured in any one of the approaches to writing. All the main points right from the hooks to the subheadings should follow the same style of the writing you began with. 

**Step 3:** Establishing Credibility (3 Ways)

	Telling that you are the expert
	You went out and seeked the advice of an Expert and here's the curation
	Tell you are'nt an expert yet, but here's from your personal experience
