As a computational designer for over seven years, I've learned one thing for sure: mastering these tools isn't a cakewalk. Despite facing setbacks, I've always bounced back, ready to restart my journey. Here are three (+2) practical tips I wish I had to avoid quitting computational design multiple times:

### Setting Realistic Expectations

Yes, computational design is tough. I know! But sometimes, our initial excitement blinds us to the challenges ahead. Accepting the complexity early on is crucial. Realize that mastering a field with countless problem-solving approaches takes time. The goal here should be exploring all possible ways to solve a problem set until you find the best, efficient, and cleanest solution.

So set your expectations realistically to avoid constant learning plateaus. Stay humble, keep exploring, and trust that it'll all click one day.

### Stick to a Program

Don't fall into the trap of Tutorial Hellhole.  

The internet is brimming with noise, and endless tutorials can lead you astray. Yes, it's always fun to learn the next amazing methods and tricks, but learning without intention will lead you nowhere. Instead, opt for project-based courses.  

There's nothing quite like the satisfaction of building something tangible.

### Master the Art of Research

Become a prolific re-searcher. Learn to ask the right questions online, whether on YouTube or forums of various Computational Design Tools. You'll be amazed at the wealth of free knowledge out there. There are thousands of people like you on their forums asking the exact same doubts and queries. Look into their replies, learn, and internalize.

**BONUS**

- Looking to sharpen your logical reasoning? Look up Scratch by MIT. It's a fantastic way to kickstart your programming journey, regardless of your age. Plus, it only takes a day to master!  
- Keep track of your progress with regular check-ins and journaling. Maybe take a step back and get back to basics if you feel that some concepts are way beyond your reach!
