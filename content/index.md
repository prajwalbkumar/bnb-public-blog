### Spaces on Computational Design, Coding in AEC Tech, and Everything in Between!

***Hi! I'm Prajwal,*** and welcome to Bugs and Binary - a site where I share my interests, hoping you'll find value in them too.

> This is not a typical blog!

### Navigating this Digital Garden

This site serves as a **Personal Knowledge Management** tool for organizing my thoughts, ideas, and connections. A [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) is an online space blending a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share **seeds of thoughts** to be **cultivated in public**. Unlike a traditional blog with polished articles in reverse chronological order, a digital garden is a free-form, work-in-progress wiki.

Let's explore the categorization system I've developed to keep this garden organized:

#### 🌱 Seedlings
Most notes start as #Seedlings🌱. These nascent thoughts often arise during my ritualistic daydreaming. They are likely empty and need attention to be cultivated further.

#### 🌿 Budding
Next, there are #Budding🌿 notes. These have been cleaned up and clarified. You'll mostly find me refining these to perfection.

#### 🌳 Evergreen
Finally, notes reach the #Evergreen🌳 stage. These are reasonably complete and ready to be shared with the world. 

Given the dynamic nature of this blog, I continually update and tend to these notes as new information emerges.

### Current Focus

If you don't know me, I'm an Architect by profession, looking to break into tech. I deeply care about creating fool-proof systems.

I believe in [[Building in Public]], and here are my current projects:

- [ ] Learning the [[Revit API]]
- [ ] Deploying tools built with the [[Revit API]]
- [ ] This blog 🙋‍♂️
- [ ] Exploring ideas in [[Idea for Software]], including:
    - [ ] Developing a [[BIM TaskForce OS]], a project management tool tailored for BIM Projects in the AEC industry.

I live in India ❤️ and hail from the beautiful [Andaman and Nicobar Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andaman_and_Nicobar_Islands). Planning a trip? I'd be happy to help you with a perfect travel itinerary!
