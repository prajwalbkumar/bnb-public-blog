An instruction to the [[Runtime]] to insert a special character that affects the output of a string. 

In C# Escape Character Sequence begins with a backslash `\` followed by the character you are escaping. 

- `\n` will produce a new line
- `\t` will produce a tab in the same line.
- `\"` used twice will allow you to display (") double quotes in an output. For Example :
	`Console.WriteLine("Hello \"World\"");`
- Use backslashes twice `\\` to produce a backslash in an output. For Example to output the path of a current file.
