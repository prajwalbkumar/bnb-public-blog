## üß† Brain Dump

  
 Since ancient history, humans have resorted to  repeated actions to define rituals to define their days. Rituals bring in reliability and a sense of calmness for the person who is set to perform them.  
- It requires the least amount of human effort (in terms of creativity) and probably this is the reason why everybody loves them. 
- Good for humans bad for business. 
- Businesses focus on efficiency and while every other industry is looking forward to introduce AI  to augment their processes, the AEC Industry is quiet slow to pickup on this. 
- Thus affecting top line growth, employee satisfaction and the dreaded attrition rate. 
- Here automation comes into play. 
- One simple rule in the programming paradigm is called the DRY approach to solving problems. 
- Don't Repeat Yourself
- There's not many ways to identify potential automation workflows, rather just one. And it is the golden framework, that can be applied from making business decisions, to programming to heck even household chores. 
  
- Step 1: Look into your current workflows, see and identify the ones that make you feel miserable. (If you don't think they are miserable, maybe look for workflows that are simple dead to do that even a monkey could do! )
- All humans are meant to achieve peak productivity. It so happens only if you let the dumb computers to do the heavy lifting. 
- Step 2: Once identified, categorize them into 2 segments > does the logic to achieve the result seem super complicated, meaning is it too much of an hassle to write it down? 
- Maybe think of it in this way, can you teach the logic to a 5 Year old? Chances are if 5 year old can understand the logic, not the science, then that's the first thing that you may want to get it automated. 
- Step 3: Get hold of an automation expert, talk it out with your peers and start building it yourself, the more you get to the job of creating such solutions, the more in control you might feel. 
- Step 4: Repeat Step 1!

If there are potential ones out there! I am all ears, we are all learning everyday, and opensourcing your discoveries and solution is how we get the AEC Tech to grow!

  ## ‚úçÔ∏è First Draft

All these times, we humans have resorted to repeated actions and tasks to fullfill our daily duties. This is not just a 21st century fact, but something that our ancestors have employed the idea of rituals, or simply put repeated actions to get the job done! These rituals have brought in reliability and a sense of comfort while performing them! 

Probably good for us humans, but not so great of companies employing you! With their focus on efficiency, businesses thrive when all minds put together bring in values in terms of creativity and problem solving. So here are 3 actionable steps that can help you automate the boring stuff at work using the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Framework and put that beautiful piece of brain to drive meaningful results!

### Step 1: Identify Repetitive Tasks

Take a week to document crucial tasks and steps you might have taken to finish up a work assignment. Note the ones that are repeated frequently. See and include tasks that make you feel miserable. If they do not, then think about if these are dead enough that even a monkey could do (considering a trained one). If yes add them to your list!

### Step 2: Analyze their Automation Potential

There are certain factors that needs to put along. You need to put in the mindset of a product manager, incharge of making sure what "features" get added up to your automation workflows!

Look into the criterias such as Volume - is the task repeated often, Consistency - Is the task performed in a consistent manner every time?, Complexity - can you explain the logic to 5 year old? If the answers to all of the above are TRUE, then you have a potential for automation for the task! 

### Step 3: Implement and Iterate

Identify the tools and stack that might be needed for this automated workflow. For any idea to developed, it needs to be developed in a small silo with the software stack that your company is already comfortable in deploying. Remember we are not bringing in a radical change to our workflows, but ways and tricks to build ideas that augment our current ones. Ideations tools such as pyRevit, Grasshopper, and Dynamo help you quickly come up with the minimum viable product, which then should be vigorously tested to ensure a healthy feedback from the team members. 

### Step 4: Full Implementation
Once the idea becomes a hit, scale up! Get programmers in your organization to develop full working packages of these tools and deploy it company wide. On a scale first at first of couse! 

While you do this, also keep in mind the impact it brings in, your initial assumptions can always be wrong. Look into the time savings, error reductions and cost efficiency to keep this idea of a tool 

If you scored well on the above ways, you've just saved yourself and your peers from hours of dreadful work, and help make work enjoyable again. Automation is the only thing that doesn't need to be looked by frowning eyes. While there might be some backlashes in the way 21st century needs us to work, benefits such as improved top line growth, precision, and employee satisfaction far outweigh the downsides.

### 4 Steps to Identify and Automate the Boring Stuff at Work Using the DRY Method

Throughout history, humans have relied on repetitive actions and tasks to fulfill daily duties. This isn't just a modern phenomenon; our ancestors used rituals‚Äîrepeated actions‚Äîto get the job done. While these rituals provide reliability and comfort, they aren't great for companies focused on efficiency. Businesses thrive on creativity and problem-solving, not monotonous tasks. Here are four actionable steps to help you automate the boring stuff at work using the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) framework, freeing your mind for more meaningful work.

### Step 1: Identify Repetitive Tasks

Take a week to document crucial tasks and steps you take to complete work assignments. Note the ones that are repeated frequently, especially those that make you feel miserable. If these tasks are so simple that even a trained monkey could do them, add them to your list.

### Step 2: Analyze Their Automation Potential

Evaluate the tasks for their automation potential by considering the following criteria:
- **Volume:** Is the task repeated often?
- **Consistency:** Is the task performed consistently every time?
- **Complexity:** Can you explain the logic to a 5-year-old?

If the answers to these questions are yes, the task is a good candidate for automation.

### Step 3: Implement and Iterate

Identify the tools and stack needed for automation. Start with the software stack your company is comfortable with to develop a minimum viable product (MVP). Use tools like pyRevit, Grasshopper, and Dynamo to quickly prototype the automation. Test the MVP thoroughly to gather feedback from team members.

### Step 4: Full Implementation

Once the MVP is successful, scale up. Get programmers in your organization to develop full working packages and deploy them company-wide, starting on a smaller scale. Monitor the impact of the automation by evaluating time savings, error reduction, and cost efficiency.

If you score well on these metrics, you've saved yourself and your peers from hours of monotonous work, making work more enjoyable. Automation should be embraced, not feared. While there might be some resistance, the benefits of improved productivity, precision, and employee satisfaction far outweigh the downsides.
