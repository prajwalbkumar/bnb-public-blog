Programming gives you optionsâ€”options to shape your way of working, rather than being confined to processes set by others. Just as in programming, there isnâ€™t a single path to achieving results, and the same applies to how we approach delivering projects in the AEC industry.

Whatâ€™s truly remarkable is how integral this mindset has become. Today, almost every challenge in our workflows can be met with a programming solution. The conversation has shifted from "Can we use programming?" to "How can we leverage it to innovate and streamline?"

Here are three key ways programming has transformed AEC workflows in ways previously unimaginable:

### Customization Over Conformity

AEC companies donâ€™t thrive with one-size-fits-all solutions. Every client and region has unique needs, and while standards like ISO 19650 set certain guidelines, they donâ€™t address every aspect of the process. Programming allows us to customize workflows and tools to meet specific requirements, offering greater control and flexibility, rather than forcing us to adapt to rigid systems.

### Efficiency at Scale

Repetitive tasks like generating construction sets or performing audits can waste valuable time and resourcesâ€”both human and computationalâ€”unless theyâ€™re automated. I canâ€™t recall the last time I didnâ€™t rely on plugins to improve productivity. Programming lets you scale efficiency effortlessly, multiplying your impact without multiplying your effort.

### Creative Freedom

In an industry often limited by constraints, programming offers the freedom to break through. Parametric design empowered architects to explore creative possibilities, so should be the case for the later stages to ensures that what you design is accurately realized. The gap between vision and execution is shrinking, thanks to these advances.

Our workflows has long needed a tech overhaul. While some are content with vendor lock-in solutions, companies like Snaptrude, Anker, Giraffe, and ThatOpenCompany are making meaningful impacts, pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible and making the process of designing buildings more efficientâ€”and fun!
