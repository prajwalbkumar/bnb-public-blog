I remember Switch Case from the 12th Grade, learning C++ I think. 

This is similar to [[Conditionals]] the common if and else statements. 

The difference lies in the implementation. The compiler checks the case to match exactly with the value inside the switch statements. 

This would lastly mean that it would take up a Conditional and match it with the 2 values to get a true or false statement. But in a more fancier. 

You can check the same Switch statements and match it to as many cases as possible. This could a bit efficient, since you are not checking the condition to match to again and again. 

Takes up a base container to check the value against!

[[Why would anybody use a Switch Case Statement if they already had the regular Conditional If Else Statement]]

Consider it as an alternative to a MCQs. They just give you a set options for a given value. 

Not as powerful as a typical IF and ELSE [[Conditionals]] might be a better option.
