What is the greatest amount of time will the algo take depending on the number of inputs 
BIG 'O' notation

Where 'n' is the number of 
O(nÂ²)
O(n log n)
O(n) [[Linear Search]]
O(log n) [[Binary Search]]
...

What does the Log base actually do!?

O - this is the upper limit of the algorithm time.  - The algo would not take more than this amount of time. 

Omega - Given the any number of input, what is the fewest number of steps the algo might take.
