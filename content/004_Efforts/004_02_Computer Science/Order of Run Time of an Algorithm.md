A framework to identify the efficiency of an algorithm.

What is the greatest amount of time will the algo take depending on the number of inputs

[[BIG 'O' Notation]]

Where 'n' is the number of 
O(nÂ²)
O(n log n)
O(n) [[Linear Search]]
O(log n) [[Binary Search]]
O(1)

What does the Log base actually do!?

O - this is the upper bound of the algorithm time.  - The algo would not take more than this amount of time. 

Omega - this is the lower bound of the algorithm time. Given the any number of input, what is the fewest number of steps the algo might take. 

Pheta - this happens if the Omega and O of the runtime is the same.
