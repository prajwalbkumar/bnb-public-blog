We need to declare variables with the specific Datatypes. Since C is an older language.  
## Available Data types in C

### `int` 
- Takes 4 bytes / 32 bits of integer. 
- Range of possible numbers is limited.
- From Negative 2 Billion to Positive 2 Billion
### `unsigned int`
- It is a qualifier that can be applied to certain datatypes.
- It can effectively double the positive range of variables of the type by disallowing negative values.
- From 0 to 4 Billion
### `char`
- Used to store Characters
- Takes 1 byte / 8 bit of memory
- ACII allows mapping of characters to various numbers. 
### `float`
* Real numbers with decimals
* Takes 4 bytes / 32 bits of memory
* They have a precision problem there is just 32 bits to work with

### `double`
They take 8 bytes / 64 bits of information
Used to store variables with floating-point values / real numbers

### `void`
It is a type and not a data type.
It does exist.
Functions can return void. It means it doesn't take any parameters.
It takes a placeholder, when there is no return value associated with the function.

## Available Data Types in CS50.h

### `bool`
Used to store Boolean values
True or False

### `string`
used to store variables to store a series of characters / word
