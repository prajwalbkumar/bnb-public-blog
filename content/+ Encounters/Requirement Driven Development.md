Imagine you want to write a blog post or a script. First, you need to define your test/requirements.

They can be about the format:

- There must be a title
- The content should be between 500 and 1000 words

About the style:

- It should be written in the first person
- A 12-year-old kid should be able to understand it

Or even about the content:

- I should give the reader a clear answer to the question, “How can I be more productive?”
- The first three paragraphs should generate a lot of curiosity to hook the reader
- Each paragraph should flow nicely to the next one

Now, and this is extremely important, you must do the **minimum** work possible to pass the tests.
