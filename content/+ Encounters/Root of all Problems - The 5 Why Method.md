The best way to resolve a recurring issue is to find out the core reason of it's occurance. 

The best way to get hold of this is to ask Why a total of 5 Times. 

For Example:

Problem 1 just happened. 

You Ask why did this happen. - 1st Why
Then ask why did the 1st Why happen - 2nd Why
Then the Third Why
The Fourth Why
And stop at the Fifth Why and work about improving on this little issue. 

Be careful though, never let yourself come down to the conclusion to [[Blame others]] unless someone becomes a physical/mental block for you.
