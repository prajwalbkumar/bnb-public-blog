Class is a way to represent an object. All objects in a class own [[Method]]. What programmers care for is a Method, and since methods only accessed from an object of a class, is when Class becomes relevant. 

A lot of Dot `.` is common while mentioning Methods of a Class. Dots here is the [[Member Access Operator]].
