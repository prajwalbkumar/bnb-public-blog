## üß† Brain Dump

  
* World moves ahead with automation.
* The speed of delivery and precision, not to mention need for sustainable solution calls for computational methods and workflows to save the day. 
* The light speed development of the tools in the industry needs to be seen with the eyes of a software engineer to master to reach it's peak performance. 

- Companies themselves are more inclined Digital Delivery Solutuions, because heck, to break even in profitability in this industry. 
- Programming and building custom tools is the best way for a business to look forward, but the cost of maintaining production grade tools could not always cater to all businesses of varying sizes. 
- Takes better part of an engineer's time to make it to production,.. 

- The learning curve is higher, especially when it needs one to learn computer architecture, logical reasoning, and use of efficient solutions in industrial grade environment. 

- Visual programming needs a lot less fuel to break into. The barier for entry is less. 
- The main reason lies behind the reason that the developer of these tools have abstracted the heavy lifting behind reasonable components in case for tools like grasshopper. The drag and drop feature of these tools allows the user to build complex workflows and automation procedures. 
 
- Minimal bugs to make things work. Time from Idea to Prototype is quick. Developing quick ideas, collaboration over team over a shared and easy language make it the choice.

- Gap between the teams. 
- Collaboration is key. Tools like Grasshopper, Dynamo have faired pretty well in the industry since they have the best possibility for interoperability. 

- One of the most welcoming and strongest community. It really doesn't matter where you are, there's always a person, ready to give you their two cents. Just like this post :P


- Ease of Learning
- Visual Nature
- Instant Feedback
- Integrated Tools and API
- Quick Iteration
- Interactive Design
- Scalability
- Tailored Solutions

## ‚úçÔ∏è First Draft

The AEC industry has seen significant advancements in recent years, from innovative construction methods to new building materials. One major area of growth is in automation and digital delivery, which improves efficiency and drives innovation. For tech inclined employees - lets call them "Super Users" - this opens up new avenues and opportunities to build innovative solutions and workflows.

To becoming a Super User learning a programming language to create custom tools might seem appealing, but here are 6 reasons why visual programming might help you better achieve this goal. 

### Barier to Entry
Learning to Code is pretty easy. Using them to creating a workable solution is tough. Visual Programming helps one to quickly get to working. It's intuitive graphical nature lowers the Barier for entry especially for ones without a formal background in Computer Science. Unlike traditional programming, visual programming uses a drag-and-drop approach, allowing users to create complex workflows and ideas. 
### You Are Not Technically interacting with the Metal
Working with tools like Grasshopper and Dynamo might make you feel in control since you are not interacting with the bare computer metal to create those workflows. The developers of these tools did the heavy lifting, and abstracted away all the complexities that comes around with Computer Architecture, Memory Allocation, etc into "batteries". This helps one to build complex solutions on the fly!

### Shorter Turn Around Time from Idea to an MVP
One of the crucial steps in the development of a workflow is building a Minimum Viable Product. Visual Programming with all the abstracted tools help you take an idea and bring it into life quickly. There's minimum bugs and the fact that it offers quick feedback, allows for easy troubleshooting, if let's say the Logic is sound.   

### Tailored Solutions
Building custom softwares the hard way, could actually prove to be difficult if the requirements and the problem that you are solving changes with every project, Visual programming can aid in modifying the "Source Code" to tailor fit the problem at hand. This creates better solutions and gives teams the power to keep things in Control.

### Interoperability with Common Tools
Interoperability is one of the major reasons why anybody would suggest getting into Visual Programming. Imagine a scenario where all of your programs do not have a way to talk with each other - this is another nightmare that one wouldn't want in their work. Having the ability to transfer data into another softwares' native format gives way for teams to be reliable on these tools, especially when reliability is key in an Industrial Grade Workflow. 

### Extendibility
Now to make things clear, not everything can be achieved using Visual Programming. The limitation is due to the fact that the developers of these tools could not have possibly build every component or node that one would require in the future. This is why many of these tools also allow for Hard Coding in the programming language of your choice within their interface, allowing you to build custom components that do the work that you wished your Visual Programming had. So maybe coding may not be everybody, but surely Visual Programming is.

# 5 Reasons Why Visual Programming is - in Most Cases - the Best Way to Break into Tech in the AEC Industry

The AEC industry has seen significant advancements in recent years, from innovative construction methods to new building materials. One major area of growth is in automation and digital delivery, which improves efficiency and drives innovation. For tech-inclined professionals this opens up new avenues and opportunities to build innovative solutions and workflows. 

While learning a programming language to create these custom tools might seem appealing, here are five reasons why visual programming might help you build better.

### Reason 1: Barrier to Entry

Learning to code is relatively easy, but creating a workable solution can be tough. Visual programming helps you quickly get to a functional product. Its intuitive graphical nature lowers the barrier to entry, especially for those without a formal background in computer science. The best part? - visual programming uses a drag-and-drop approach, allowing users to create complex workflows and ideas.

### Reason 2: You Are Not Technically Interacting with the Metal

Using tools like Grasshopper and Dynamo feels empowering since you are not dealing directly with concepts like low-level computer architecture or memory allocation. The developers of these tools have done the heavy lifting, abstracting away the complexities into "batteries" that you can use to build complex solutions quickly.

### Reason 3: Shorter Turnaround Time from Idea to MVP

A crucial step in developing a workflow is building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Visual programming, with its abstracted tools, helps you take an idea and bring it to life quickly. There are minimal bugs, and the quick feedback allows for easy troubleshooting, provided the logic is sound.

### Reason 4: Tailored Solutions

Building custom software the hard way can be challenging, especially if project requirements change frequently. Visual programming allows you to modify the "source code" to fit the specific problem at hand, creating better solutions and giving teams more control.

### Reason 5:¬† Extendibility

Not everything can be achieved using visual programming due to the limitations in pre-built components or nodes. However, many visual programming tools allow for hard coding within their interfaces, enabling you to create custom components when needed. While coding may not be for everyone, visual programming provides a versatile and accessible alternative.
