While calling a [[Method]], some values can be passed into the parenthesis or the [[Method Invocation Operator]]. These values are called arguments. The method uses these arguments in its specific way that is defined in the [[Method Signature]]. 

Methods can have 0 or more arguments. 

Parameters are the actual variables that are supplied as containers to the Method. Arguments are the values in them. The supplied arguments must be compatible with parameter [[Data Type]]
