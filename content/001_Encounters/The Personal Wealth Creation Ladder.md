# Time for Money 

- Job at DAR. Earning Rs 60000/month
- Hourly Job at Novatr. Earning Rs. 25000/month

> Write and Blog more to find better Jobs. Upskill and Learn in Public to get high quality job offers

# Your own Service Business

- I wish to get into UpWork, getting high quality clients.

- Initially I would get into Rendering and Architecture Work

- Upwork is just one way to do it. Ideally the way forward is to attract jobs for Computational Design and other related jobs. Writing blogs and showing leadership would be providing with the necessary push, not just in UpWork but also in LinkedIn etc. 

- Creating courses and live teaching and mentorship calls

> Use your skills and contact using blogs to create subject matter expertise. Learn on the job of a developer within 1 year. Post 1 year, I should have the ability to create software solutions on the fly

# Productized Services 

- By this point, I would have left my Job and started my own fulltime thing. 
- Either this or would be in some senior level positions to provide such services. 
- Private Consultation and Freelance Agency
# Selling Products 

- Developing in House Tools for Sale
- Courses on How to Create them
- EBook on how to create them 

# Next Steps

- Start a Freelance Business with what Skills you have. Offer Computational Design, Modelling, Revit and Rendering Jobs. Do it well. Learn all there is to be a successful Freelancer
- Start that blog seriously. Build that to enable that funnel, bringing subject matter expertise. 
- Learn to Code, and focus on building skills that would help you get top Jobs. Begin with Python and make sure to be the best at it. Learn the Revit API. Be a master in it. Begin with Revit API I should say, then Rhino things. Because issues with Rhino is very rare. 
- Also make sure that you master Grasshopper this year. 

This is the highlight for the year. By the end of 2024, I should have a freelance business setup, blog done properly, and develop all coding acumen there is to learn.
