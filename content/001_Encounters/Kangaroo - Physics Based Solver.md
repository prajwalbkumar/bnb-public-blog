[[Architects need to respect physics in Nature]]

[[Frei Otto - People]] the OG of Physics based Tensile Membranes. He did what he loved. His interest in Tensile Membrane structures. 

[[Buckminster Fuller - People]] created a solid tensegrity models for his Hexagonal shaped structures. 

[[Dynamic Relaxation Techniques]] is what used by Kangaroo under the hood.


## 3 Important Concepts in Kangaroo

### Forces
Push or Pull that can be applied to the geometries. 

### Constraints
Rules that would limit the behaviour of the topology

### Goals
Ways to interpret your design outcomes. How much, what and when are kind of the stuff that you need the forces and constraint to result to.  

For 3D Geometries, Kangaroo always needs Meshes

Mesh topology is very convoluted. To extract vertices is a long game.
