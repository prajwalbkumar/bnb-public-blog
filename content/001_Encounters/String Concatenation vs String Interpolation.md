### String Concatenation
Combining multiple strings together into a new string value.

Syntax:
Combining [[Literal String]] (s) or string [[Variable]] (s) together using `+`

### String Interpolation
Instead of using `+` use it inside a doubles quotes under a template and using one or more [[Interpolation Expression]].

Basically a literal string but becomes a template when the `$` character is used before the `" "`. The Dollar Symbol makes anything inside the { curly braces} a live C# variable or expression. Similar to [[Python]]'s version of `print({}.format(first name)`

We can also combined [[Verbatim Literal String]] using the `@` key with String Interpolation. The follar symbol just makes anything inside the {curly braces} versatile C# function.

[[Syntax Highlighting]] makes it easier to understand what would get printed out "literally" and what is a dynamic component in a line.

You save some extra keystrokes when using String Interpolation
