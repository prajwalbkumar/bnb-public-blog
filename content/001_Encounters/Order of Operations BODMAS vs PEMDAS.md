The [[CSharp Programming Language]] follows the PEMDAS method common in US contries as opposed to BODMAS used commonly in the UK and other Commonwealth Countries including India. 

**PEMDAS**: Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.
**BODMAS**: Brackets, Order, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction

Pretty much the same though!
