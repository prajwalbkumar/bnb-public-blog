Revit is not needed everywhere and every time. A Web based IFC File Viewer that is tie down with the Organization SSO.

A cheaper way for organizations to manage products on the web that can be developed to have a full suite of commenting, assigning of issues capabilties. 

### How does it work?
An automated script is made to run at the end of every day in Revit. This script extracts 3D Geometry in the IFC format. Since IFC4 supports NURBS, it can be a boon to view Free Form Curved Elements and Objects in the BIM Model. 

The File is stored at the Server Level point containing nothing but IFC Files.

These IFC Files are given an access only if the items are available in the PMIS. 
The PMIS allows for BIM Coordinators to regularly access and inspect the model instead of using any other software.

Issues and Clashes and similar items are assigned to team members and with the Microsoft Teams API, is assigned and intimated to the respective designee.
