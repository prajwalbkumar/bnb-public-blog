This is a strong and easiest way to showcase that you are learning and starting to learn a lot. 

How? Try finding people who create content, it could be a YouTube video, a Podcast, book, podcast, a great piece of code, or a huge ass software. See if it is new and pick "it" up. 

By picking it up, we mean to review it, acknowledge it, butter it if it genuinely helps, or appreciate it by adding it in your [[Cheat Sheet]].
It may be lying in the ground, and might not have taken off as the next big idea, but is definitely important to the creator. Here the creator can be anybody, but it would be great if he/she be the best and famous in the business.
