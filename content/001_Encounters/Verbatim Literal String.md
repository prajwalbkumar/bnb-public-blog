If adding [[Character Escape Sequence]] seems boring, then using a Verbatim Literal String helps keep the all whitespaces without the need to use escape backlashes. 

Simply use the `@` directive before the [[Literal String]]

`Console.WriteLine(@"    c:\source\repos`   
        `(this is where your code goes)");`
