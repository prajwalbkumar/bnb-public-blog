## üß† Brain Dump

-  People start to program based on their assumptions that coding or computational design is easy! 
* It is not. 
* The skill it takes to become a computational designer is that of logic and reasoning abilities of one. 
* Definitely one could pick up a tutorial or a guide, but [[Learning without Intention]] is a total waste of time
* The most issues that one can face is the thing about excitement and confidence. You may begin with the greatest of intentions
* Your excitement plateaus off after a moment since you hadn't had any positive feedback. 
* Start with some form of basic logical and reasoning building exercise. [[Scratch by MIT]] is one of the best place to begin with visual programming. 
* Start small but make incremental growth. 
* Go up to McNeel and read their forums. There are thousand of you on their forums asking the exact same doubts and queries. Look into their replies, learn and internalize. 
* Be a prolific searcher. Learn to ask the right questions on the internet. YouTube is a free university. Much of what you expect on ANY paid course to start out is most probably covered in YouTube. 
* Develop a strong network of people who keep on sharing insights and knowledge. They all of had humble beginnings. 
* There are a lot of noise out there on the internet. Try them all, but go with the one that makes you feel comfortable. Look into their curriculum. See their pace and the kind of project they build.
* Project based learning is the best form of learnings. You know your intent, you get a feedback for what you are building. 
* Slow Growth- Understand that Computational Design is a vast field, with application in almost all of the design industry with 100s of ways to accomplish a task. Its only time that would give you the gift of understanding, which ways are efficient and clean.
* Do proper periodic checks on your progress. Keep a journal and document where you are going wrong. Maybe take a step back and get back to basics.

## ‚úçÔ∏è First Draft

 ## Introduction:

I have been a computational designer for more than 7 years now and within these years one thing that I can say for sure is that learning any one of these tools is not easy. Sure I have had my fair share of dropping out, but eventually I always come back springing up to restart my Journey. 

Here are my 3 (+2) reasonable tips that I wish I would have gotten to avoid leaving computational design multiple times so that you don't have to go through this today!

### Setting up your expectations
Yes, computational design is tough. I know that, you know that. But our brains when fully excited while starting out may probably not expect this.

Accepting that to understand a field that has applications in almost any design field with probably a million ways to solve a given problem would take time to master. The goal here should be one, exploring all possible ways to solve a problem set until you find the best, efficient and cleanest way to solve it. 

The utmost skill that a computational designer needs is that of Logical Reasoning. Setting up your expectation realistically early on will not result in plateaued experience. Stay humble and accept, that one day it will all make sense. 

### Take a program and stick to it
Don't get stuck in the [[Tutorial Hellhole]].

There's a lot of noise on the internet, and obviously there's thousands of tutorials and guides on computational design tools. While it is always fun to learn the next amazing methods, but learning without an intention will lead you nowhere. 

Next time you look into staring out a course make sure that it is a project based course. Trust me the best feeling is when you see yourself **BUILDING** something. 

### Learn to Search - For People, For Questions and For Answers
Become a prolific re-searcher. 

Learn to ask the right questions on the internet. YouTube is a free university. Much of what you expect on ANY paid course to start out is most probably covered on YouTube. If that doesn't suffice, go up to McNeel Forums and become part of the community. There are thousand of you on their forums asking the exact same doubts and queries. Look into their replies, learn and internalize. 

BONUS
* If you are pretty new here and want to start out with building your logical reasoning skill, learn and develop Scratch by MIT. It is one of the best way that kids begin their programming journey, and surprisingly a lot of adults take pleasure in building something out of their pre made coding blocks! It takes a week top to master!
* Do proper periodic checks on your progress. Keep a journal and document where you are going wrong. Maybe take a step back and get back to basics if you feel that some concepts are way beyond your reach!

##  ‚úÖ Final Essay

As a computational designer for over seven years, I've learned one thing for sure: mastering these tools isn't a cakewalk. Despite facing setbacks, I've always bounced back, ready to restart my journey. Here are three (+2) practical tips I wish I had to avoid quitting computational design multiple times:

### Setting Realistic Expectations

Yes, computational design is tough. I know! But sometimes, our initial excitement blinds us to the challenges ahead. Accepting the complexity early on is crucial. Realize that mastering a field with countless problem-solving approaches takes time. The goal here should be exploring all possible ways to solve a problem set until you find the best, efficient, and cleanest solution.

So set your expectations realistically to avoid constant learning plateaus. Stay humble, keep exploring, and trust that it'll all click one day.

### Stick to a Program

Don't fall into the trap of Tutorial Hellhole.  

The internet is brimming with noise, and endless tutorials can lead you astray. Yes, it's always fun to learn the next amazing methods and tricks, but learning without intention will lead you nowhere. Instead, opt for project-based courses.  

There's nothing quite like the satisfaction of building something tangible.

### Master the Art of Research

Become a prolific re-searcher. Learn to ask the right questions online, whether on YouTube or forums of various Computational Design Tools. You'll be amazed at the wealth of free knowledge out there. There are thousands of people like you on their forums asking the exact same doubts and queries. Look into their replies, learn, and internalize.

**BONUS**

- Looking to sharpen your logical reasoning? Look up Scratch by MIT. It's a fantastic way to kickstart your programming journey, regardless of your age. Plus, it only takes a day to master!  
- Keep track of your progress with regular check-ins and journaling. Maybe take a step back and get back to basics if you feel that some concepts are way beyond your reach!
