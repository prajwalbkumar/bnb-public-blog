## üß† Brain Dump

- Over years I have found myself among some of the best Computational Designers to be known. 
- The way they think and deal with a solution, is something one can always learn from. 
- You may not agree with a particular style of one's work, but waiting out till you see the final outcome only to see a different possibiltiy is one of the saubhagya of being a computational designer. 
- One Problem countless solutions. 

- Here are the 3 types of Computational Designer that I think can be categorized to help you see where you lie. 

- Write in a statement, like the person is going through a self discovery phase. Check it out, it must make sense.
 
 - Companies might favour one type. For people to have coherance. 
- It may 

- The perfect aim would be to be a mix of all three

## ‚úçÔ∏è First Draft

Over years I have had the opportunity and privilege to see and learn from the best Computational Designers out there. The way each approached problems seemed peculiar, but it all made sense in the end. This got me into thinking, if you were to find "your way of code" can one tell themselves apart from others based on their approach to problem solving? Here's my take on it. Whether you are a seasoned professional or just a Code Noobie, there are broadly three categories in which one might categorize themselves. 
### The Perfectionist
Probably the most common one, being a perfectionist can be a double edged sword. You might find them spending hours tweaking the smallest details to achieve absolute precision. They are obsessed with clean code, naming conventions and flawless execution. Except for the downside - Paralysis by Analysis. The Perfectionist can get caught up in the details that projects take much longer to complete!

Which is why the next one on the list is my favorite! 
### The Innovator
The Innovators are one of the most fun ones! Their solutions are often unpredictable and are never afraid to try the "Next New Toy" in the market. These guys spend most of their time learning and then putting those learnings to action. They are not afraid to break the rules of code and always seem to be pushing the boundaries of what's possible. 

### The Pragmatist
The complete opposite of the Innovator, the Pragmatist can go by the saying "Done is better than perfect". They favour functionality over efficiency, and prefer tried-and-true methods that gets the job done quickly and effectively. Their solutions are mostly practical and the quickest one to be executed among the three.


### The Balanced Computational Designer
The ultimate aim for me - if you ask - would be the mix of all three! This balanced mindset allows your to leverage the strength of each type while mitigating the weaknesses. Where time is of the essence, being a Pragmatist help, when critical problems needs to be resolved, an innovator takes the stage, and when it comes to reliability and collaboration, a perfectionist takes the spot. 

Which type do you think you resonate with the most?

# The 3 Archetypes of Computational Designers - Finding Your Way of Code

Over the years, I have had the opportunity and privilege to learn from some of the best computational designers. Each approached problems in their unique way, but all their ways worked out in the end. This got me thinking: can one identify their "way of code" based on their problem-solving approach? Here's my take. Whether you are a seasoned professional or a newbie, you might find yourself fitting into one of these three categories.

### The Perfectionist

Probably the most common type, being a perfectionist can be a double-edged sword. Perfectionists spend hours tweaking the smallest details to achieve absolute precision. They are obsessed with clean code, naming conventions, and flawless execution. However, the downside is paralysis by analysis. Perfectionists can get so caught up in the details that projects take much longer to complete.

Which is why the next type is my favorite!

### The Innovator

The Innovators are one of the most fun types. Their solutions are often unpredictable, and they are never afraid to try the "next new toy" in the market. They spend most of their time learning and putting those learnings into action. Innovators are not afraid to break the rules of code and always push the boundaries of what's possible.

And then, there are those who value practicality over experimentation.

### The Pragmatist

The complete opposite of the Innovator, the Pragmatist follows the saying "done is better than perfect." They favor functionality over efficiency and prefer tried-and-true methods that get the job done quickly and effectively. Their solutions are practical and the quickest to execute among the three types.

### The Balanced Computational Designer

The ultimate aim for me would be a mix of all three types. This balanced mindset allows you to leverage the strengths of each type while mitigating their weaknesses. When time is of the essence, being a Pragmatist helps. When critical problems need to be resolved, an Innovator takes the stage. For reliability and collaboration, a Perfectionist is essential.

Which type do you resonate with the most?
